# Raspberry Pi Temperature Sensor
### Why I Chose a Temperature Sensor
I was searching for a Raspberry Pi related project to do because I had wanted to get a Raspberry Pi for a while now and this was a 
good excuse to buy one. When I was searching for a project to do, most of them were either really expensive because they involved Amazon Cloud services to use. These require subscriptions. Other projects involved hardware that would be either too expensive, or too complex to create in a short amount of time. The temperature sensor is a project that is not that expensive or difficult, and could be integrated into a much bigger project.
### What is it?
The temperature sensor that I used is a ds18B20. The ones I used are particularly waterproof. The temperature sensor communicates with the 
Raspberry Pi via an electrical circuit. Once the circuit is made, a python script must be used in order for the Raspberry Pi to read the data from the sensor.
